# Smart-Hand-Glove-IoT
The goal of the project was to create a way for the speech-impaired to be able to communicate with the general public more easily. 
With a variety of flex sensors, the state of the right hand in a series of numerical data can be quantified. By collecting a moderate
amount of this data for each letter or word and feeding it into a computer algorithm, it can train over this dataset and learn to 
associate a given hand gesture with its corresponding sign. The flex Sensors are used as variable resistors to detect how much each 
finger is bent, and the arduino board can identify the orientation and hand movements that the Flex sensors cannot capture. 

The complete Code is written inside textto_speech.ino file and for gaming part we have to install a software named as 'processing' and
then run the code which is inside gameandcontrol.pde
